DelftBlue (for TU Delft employees only)
=======================================

prerequisites
-------------

Click `here <https://doc.dhpc.tudelft.nl/delftblue/crash-course/>`_ for background information, how the cluster works, and instructions to access the cluster.
Staff, postdocs, and PhD students have access granted, so no action is needed. Master students need to request access.

After login, load the following modules:

.. code-block:: bash

   module load 2025
   module load cmake
   module load ninja
   module load intel/oneapi-all

.. tip::

   It is useful to place these modules in the ``~/.bashrc`` file so that they are automatically loaded as soon as you log in again.

   .. code-block:: bash

      echo "# load required modules" >> ~/.bashrc
      echo module load 2025 >> ~/.bashrc
      echo module load cmake >> ~/.bashrc
      echo module load ninja >> ~/.bashrc
      echo module load intel/oneapi-all >> ~/.bashrc

installation SWASH
------------------

1. download SWASH

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/citg/wavemodels/swash.git && cd swash

2. configure SWASH

.. code-block:: bash

   make config fc=mpiifort mpi=on

3. build SWASH

.. code-block:: bash

   make

4. install SWASH

.. code-block:: bash

   make install

SWASH is installed at folder ``$HOME/wavemodels/swash`` by default.
To run SWASH, you need to make sure that the ``/bin`` folder in this directory is added to your system's ``PATH``:

.. code-block:: bash

   echo export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/wavemodels/swash/bin >> ~/.bash_profile
   source ~/.bash_profile
